However, reconstructing ancient genomes is complicated by the poor preservation of DNA retrieved from ancient samples. Technological advances in the retrieval and analysis of ancient DNA have now made it possible for us to reconstruct the genomes of several Neandertals, as well as to identify a previously unknown and now-extinct Asian hominin group related to Neandertals, who we call “Denisovans”. These archaic genome sequences have provided many insights into Neandertals and Denisovans, and have also revealed their interactions with modern humans. We have shown, for example, that gene flow occurred between archaic and modern humans, and have assessed the likely functional consequences of archaic DNA sequences in present-day people using publically available genome, gene expression, and phenotype datasets. I will highlight the role that archaic DNA has played in shaping the genetic landscape of contemporary populations, as well as describing some of the methodological challenges in the analysis of ancient DNA."},{"Session":"Keynote","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"8:45-9:45","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"keynote","Speaker":"Dana Pe'er","Title":"Machine learning meets single-cell biology: Cellular dynamics and gene programs","Abstract":"Single-cell genomics is providing unprecedented views into the workings of cells and their interrelationships. Beginning with the conceptualization of cell states as residing along a phenotypic manifold and its representation as a neighbor graph, we will survey approaches to infer trajectories and cell-state transitions from this data. To understand dynamics along the manifold from snapshot data, we can model differentiation as a Markov process, thereby providing a continuous view of cell fate choices and enabling a quantification of cellular plasticity. We will demonstrate the versatility of this approach, provide cooking tips and pitfalls to avoid, and discuss computational challenges. We will also highlight the importance of understanding gene expression and regulation based on its structure in the data. To identify biologically meaningful gene programs, we leverage Bayesian matrix factorization, combining prior knowledge with data to summarize biological activity as a compact set of factors representing cellular building blocks. This presentation will cover several single-cell algorithms, including Wanderlust, Palantir, CellRank, Decipher and Spectra."},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"10:30-11:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Burkhard Rost","Title":"Artificial Intelligence captures language of life written in proteins","Abstract":null},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"11:10-11:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Recep Adiyaman","Title":"Improvement of protein tertiary and quaternary structure predictions using the ReFOLD refinement method and the AlphaFold2 recycling process","Abstract":null},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"11:30-11:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Brennan Abanades","Title":"ImmuneBuilder: Deep-Learning models for predicting the structures of immune proteins.","Abstract":"Immune receptor proteins play a key role in the immune system and have shown great promise as biotherapeutics. The structure of these proteins is critical for understanding their antigen binding properties. Here, we present ImmuneBuilder, a set of deep learning models trained to accurately predict the structure of antibodies (ABodyBuilder2), nanobodies (NanoBodyBuilder2) and T-Cell receptors (TCRBuilder2). We show that ImmuneBuilder generates structures with state of the art accuracy while being far faster than AlphaFold2. For example, on a benchmark of 34 recently solved antibodies, ABodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an RMSD of 2.81√Ö, a 0.09√Ö improvement over AlphaFold-Multimer, while being over a hundred times faster. Similar results are also achieved for nanobodies, (NanoBodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an average RMSD of 2.89√Ö, a 0.55√Ö improvement over AlphaFold2) and TCRs. By predicting an ensemble of structures, ImmuneBuilder also gives an error estimate for every residue in its final prediction. ImmuneBuilder is made freely available, both to download (https:\/\/github.com\/oxpig\/ImmuneBuilder) and to use via our webserver (http:\/\/opig.stats.ox.ac.uk\/webapps\/newsabdab\/sabpred).

Most evaluations of the method to date have focused on model accuracy on individual protein domains, with relatively less attention paid to accuracy of inter-domain arrangements in multi-domain proteins. Here, we examine AlphaFold2‚Äôs performance in accurately predicting structures for multi-domain proteins. Using multi-domain models in the AlphaFold database with known experimental structures, we assess model accuracy in relation to template availability at the time of prediction. We also develop means to assess the accuracy of domain arrangements that are not represented in AlphaFold2‚Äôs training set. We find that although AlphaFold2 exhibits high performance overall, there is clear room for improvement in multi-domain structure prediction, particularly on longer proteins bearing specific domain interactions that were not observed during training. For some multi-domain targets on which poor performance is seen, we show how improved accuracy may be obtained using AlphaFold2 with non-standard running protocols."},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"12:10-12:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Castrense Savojardo","Title":"CoCoNat: prediction of coiled-coil regions using protein language models","Abstract":"Coiled-coils domains (CCDs) are found in proteins in all kingdoms of life. They perform a wide range of important cellular functions. Canonical Coiled-Coil Domains (CCD) consist of interwined alpha helices containing heptad repeats (labeled abcdefg, the so-called registers) with constraint pairing. CCDs are classified according to the number and orientation of the Œ±‚Äêhelices involved, i.e, by their oligomerization state. The importance of CCDs demands computational methods for predicting the presence and localization of CCDs, including registers, and their oligomerization state. Here we present CoCoNat (https:\/\/coconat.biocomp.unibo.it), a novel deep-learning based method for predicting CCD regions, registers and oligomerization state. Our method, for the first time, adopts a sequence encoding based on two state-of-the-art protein Language Models (pLMs): ProtT5 and ESM1-b. The pLMs embedding are processed by a three-step architecture including a deep network, a conditional random field and single-layer feed forward network. We trained CoCoNat on a dataset comprising 2191 proteins containing CCDs and 9040 proteins not endowed with CCD. When tested on a blind test set comprising 429 CCD and 278 non-CCD proteins, CoCoNat overpasses the current state-of-the-art both for residue-level and segment-level CCD detection, register annotation as well as oligomerization state prediction."},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"13:50-14:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"panel","Speaker":"Rafael Najmanovich","Title":"3DSIG: Past, Present and Future","Abstract":"3DSIG has come a long way since its start as a satellite meeting.

Baulin","Title":"CoRToise - Computational RNA Topoisomerase","Abstract":"It's now known that the function of non-coding RNAs is largely determined by their structure. In turn, the folding of the RNA structure is dictated by its sequence. The high structural complexity of non-coding RNAs can be the result of multiple recombination events during the RNA world period. Recently, examples of such natural recombinations preserving the structure and function were discovered for hammerhead ribozymes. However, the studies of RNA sequence rearrangements are highly limited by the computational complexity of the problem. Here, we present a program CoRToise (Computational RNA Topoisomerase) for finding potential backbone rearrangement sites in RNA 3D structures and performing sequence permutations. CoRToise limits the search for potential breakpoints to spatially close O3‚Ä≤-P atom pairs of residues distant in sequence and permutes the RNA sequence\/structure fragments by reconnecting them exhaustively. Using the tool we found several cases of pseudoknotted RNA structures turning into nested structures after a series of rearrangements, and multiple reciprocal cases. CoRToise can be utilized to explore the landscape of permuted variants of a given structure and find the most stable variant possibly more functionally efficient. Such a tool will be useful in the analysis of the RNA sequence-structure-function relationships and in RNA design."},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"16:20-16:40","Format":"Live-stream","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Davyd Bohdan","Title":"ARTEM tool for searching motifs in RNA 3D structures","Abstract":"The spatial structure of non-coding RNAs is crucial in determining its functions. It is known that RNA structures are modular, which allows us to consider their structure as a composition of building blocks called tertiary motifs. The ability to recognize and search for similar motifs by superimposing structures on each other is one of the main tasks of structural biology. Here we present the ARTEM tool for sequence-, topology-, and annotation-independent superposition of two arbitrary RNA 3D structures. The algorithm used in ARTEM allows finding similar motifs in topologically different structural contexts and handles both local and long-range motifs (formed by loops and helices distant in sequence or from different chains). To demonstrate the capabilities of ARTEM we performed a search for RNA 3D motifs structurally similar to the D-loop\/T-loop interaction motif from tRNA. We found D-loop\/T-loop-like motifs in tRNA, Y RNA, viral tRNA-like UTR, Hatchet ribozyme, RNase P, several riboswitches, and numerous matches were found in archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic rRNAs. We believe ARTEM will have a significant impact in the field of RNA structural studies, especially in the comparative analysis of RNA structures and RNA-containing complexes."},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"16:40-17:00","Format":"Live-stream","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Md Mahfuzur Rahaman","Title":"RNAMotifComp: a comprehensive method to analyze and identify structurally similar RNA motif families","Abstract":null},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"17:00-17:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Marin Matic","Title":"Dissecting the sequence and structure determinants of GPCR - Gprotein selectivity via structural bioinformatics and machine learning","Abstract":"GPCRs transduce extracellular signals to intracellular pathways by coupling with heterotrimeric G-proteins categorized as Gs, Gi\/o, Gq\/11, and G12\/13 based on their Œ±-subunits. To understand the sequence-based coupling selectivity we created a new machine learning predictor PRECOGx. It is based on protein language models that encode structural and functional information of protein sequences. The ESM1b protein embeddings of GPCR are used as features. It predicts GPCR interactions with G protein and Œ≤-arrestin. It outperformed its predecessor (e.g., PRECOG) in predicting GPCR-transducer couplings, being also able to consider all GPCR classes. To explore the structural determinants of G-protein-coupling selectivity, we analyzed 362 available 3D structures of GPCR-G-protein complexes. Analysis of the residue contacts at the interfaces revealed a network of secondary structure elements that elucidated new and known structural features that determine coupling specificity. Through RMSD calculation, focusing on the docking mode of the G-protein Œ±-subunits with respect to the receptor we show Gs-GPCR complexes have more structural constraint and a smaller range of docking poses than Gi\/o-GPCR. Binding interface energy calculations showed that structural properties of the complexes contribute to higher stability of Gs compared to Gi\/o complexes."},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"17:20-17:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Francesca Vianello","Title":"Automating Structure-Based Design: Integrating Fragment Hotspot Maps in Drug Discovery Pipelines at Scale","Abstract":null},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"17:40-18:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Jia-Ning Li","Title":"CProMG: Controllable Protein-Oriented Molecule Generation with Desired Binding Affinity and Drug-Like Properties","Abstract":null},{"Session":"Bio-Ontologies","Room":"Salle Rhone 3a","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"13:50-14:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"Núria Queralt Rosinach","Title":"COSI Opening Remarks","Abstract":null},{"Session":"Bio-Ontologies","Room":"Salle Rhone 3a","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"14:00-15:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz","Title":"Ontology Alignment for Life Sciences","Abstract":"The semantic web and life sciences research communities have extensively investigated the problem of defining correspondences between independently developed ontologies, which is usually referred to as the ontology alignment problem.

To make the infrastructure portable we used terraform to define our infrastructure as code. The architecture is well tuned for our use case: running the same pipelines with some common inputs, while scaling to meet highly variable demand for pipeline runs, at low cost. This is achieved by using AWS batch to quickly scale up and down, high bandwidth and disk I\/O instances to quickly load and read large file inputs, a caching strategy to re-use common inputs between pipeline runs, and AWS Spot Instances to lower costs. Leveraging Spot Instances can be a challenge because workloads may be interrupted, requiring workloads run on spot to implement handling for recovery. SWIPE leverages the WDL workflow definitions to automatically resume at the last completed step, freeing up workflow developers from needing to implement their own recovery logic. Coordination is handled by AWS Step Functions, a serverless workflow orchestrator.

Existing programs struggle with predicting less common gene structures (long introns, micro-exons), finding the preferred TIS location, and distinguishing pseudogenes. We present EASEL (Efficient, Accurate, Scalable Eukaryotic modeLs), an open-source genome annotation tool that leverages machine learning, RNA folding, and functional annotations to enhance gene prediction accuracy (https:\/\/gitlab.com\/PlantGenomicsLab\/easel). EASEL works by aligning high throughput short read data (RNA-Seq) and assembling putative transcripts via StringTie2 and PsiCLASS. Frames are subsequently predicted through TransDecoder using a gene family database (EggNOG) and Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) and protein hints are generated. Each gene model is independently used to train AUGUSTUS, and the resulting predictions are combined into a single gene set using AGAT. Implicated gene structures are filtered by primary and secondary features (molecular weight, GC content, free energy, etc.) with a clade-specific random forest model and then functionally annotated with EnTAP. This results in a full-scale workflow that balances efficiency and accuracy to generate high-quality genome annotations."},{"Session":"BOSC","Room":"Salle Rhone 3b","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"15:15-15:20","Format":"Live-stream","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Brett Smith","Title":"Realizing FAIR Principles For Data and Workflows with the Arvados Platform","Abstract":null},{"Session":"BOSC","Room":"Salle Rhone 3b","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"16:00-16:05","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Dimitri Perrin","Title":"Faster evaluation of CRISPR guide RNAs across entire genomes","Abstract":"The design of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs is not trivial. In particular, evaluating the risk of off-target modifications is computationally expensive: a brute-force approach would require comparing each candidate guide with every possible CRISPR target site in the genome. In a mammalian genome, this means hundreds of millions of comparisons for each guide. We have previously introduced Crackling, a gRNA design tool that relies on Inverted Signature Slice Lists (ISSL) to accelerate off-target scoring by only considering sites with partial matches (a slice) with the candidate guide. This produced an order of magnitude speed up whilst still maintaining scoring accuracy. Here, we present a complete reimplementation of Crackling in C++ and discuss further improvements. Using longer slices we perform fewer comparisons, and we show it is possible to construct a collection of slices that still preserve an exact off-target score. We have benchmarked two ISSL configurations with the new version of Crackling and report a 15-22 times speed up over the default ISSL configuration. We also show that, using memory-mapped files, this can be achieved without any significant increase in memory usage.

HLApollo shows a meaningful improvement compared to recent MHC-I models on peptide presentation (20.19% average precision (AP)). We demonstrate excellent pan-allelic generalization through a leave-one-allele-out evaluation strategy, with only a median of 9.6% reduced presentation AP. Yet, many alleles still have unacceptable performance for use in a clinical setting, so we developed a linear regression model to estimate the untrained AP. Using only a-priori information, we achieve reasonable estimates of untrained model performance, with a correlation coefficient of 67%. We evaluate the expansion of coverage to various ethnicities whose MHC genotypes have been measured, and find that pan-allelic coverage afforded by HLApollo significantly expands coverage to several underrepresented minorities. Coverage of hispanic individuals, for example, increases by over 10%.

Hence, it is useful to summarize and characterize the microbial makeup of a given environment in a way that is biologically reasonable and interpretable. The UniFrac metric has been a robust and widely-used metric for measuring the variability between metagenomic samples. We propose that the characterization of metagenomic environments can be achieved by finding the average, a.k.a. the barycenter, among the samples with respect to the UniFrac distance. However, it is possible that such a UniFrac-average includes negative entries, making it no longer a valid representation of a metagenomic community. To overcome this intrinsic issue, we propose a special version of the UniFrac metric, termed L2UniFrac, which inherits the phylogenetic nature of the traditional UniFrac and with respect to which one can easily compute the average, producing biologically meaningful environment-specific ‚Äúrepresentative samples‚Äù. We demonstrate the usefulness of such representative samples as well as the extended usage of L2UniFrac in efficient clustering of metagenomic samples, and provide mathematical characterizations and proofs to the desired properties of L2UniFrac.

The discovery of novel NRPs remains a laborious process because many NRPs consist of non-standard amino acids that are assembled by Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases (NRPSs). Adenylation domains (A-domains) in NRPSs are responsible for selection and activation of monomers appearing in NRPs. During the past decade, several support vector machine-based algorithms have been developed for predicting the specificity of the monomers present in NRPs. These algorithms utilize physiochemical features of the amino acids present in the A-domains of NRPSs. In this paper, we benchmarked the performance of various machine learning algorithms and features for predicting specificities of NRPSs and we showed that the extra trees model paired with one hot encoding features outperforms the existing approaches. Moreover, we show that unsupervised clustering of 453,560 A-domains reveals many clusters that correspond to potentially novel amino acids.

However, the influence of dataset and model design choices on the robustness and reliability of sequence features learned by these models remains unexplored. We demonstrate that contemporary design choices result in models that learn spurious sequence features that violate biologically valid causal interpretation. This phenomenon, which we term ‚Äúfeature leakage‚Äù, afflicts several state-of-the-art deep learning models of regulatory DNA such as DeepSEA, Enformer and scBasset. We identify two key design choices that result in feature leakage- biased selection of training genomic loci, and joint training of multiple tasks using canonical multi-task architectures and loss functions. Biased locus selection, such as training on the union of regulatory events (e.g. DNase-seq peaks) from multiple cellular contexts, creates an artificial enrichment and depletion of motifs of key lineage-defining TFs that are mutually exclusive across cell contexts, resulting in spurious leakage of non-causal features across tasks. Orthogonally, conventional multi-tasking architectures result in entangled shared representations that are unable to separate individual predictive sequence features. To mitigate feature leakage, we propose training single-task models using background locus selection strategies that are not biased towards regulatory events in specific cell contexts."},{"Session":"MLCSB","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"11:50-12:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Pyaree Mohan Dash","Title":"Massively parallel characterization of transcriptional regulatory elements in three diverse human cell types.","Abstract":"The human genome contains millions of candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) with cell-type-specific activities that shape both health and myriad disease states.

To address these knowledge gaps, we trained a deep learning model, ProCapNet, to predict transcription initiation, measured genome-wide at base-resolution by PRO-cap, from DNA sequence.

We next applied a model interpretation framework to identify a high-sensitivity collection of motifs predictive of transcription initiation. Then, to dissect how these motifs modulate initiation, we performed systematic in silico mutational experiments. Results suggest nuanced epistasis: motifs play specialized roles, dependent on other nearby motifs. For multiple motifs, we identified a novel secondary function as direct initiation sites.

Evolutionary scientists have been able to precisely estimate current human gene ages by studying duplication events through time. Whether genes with the same evolutionary age are associated within the genome, have similar expression or share a same chromatin structure is still not well characterized. Inspired by the atavistic theory of cancer, which relates malignancy to the expression of evolutionary ancient phenotypes, we investigate whether cell differentiation and cancer can alter the associations between gene age and other (epi)genomic characteristics. We therefore investigate whether genes with different evolutionary ages could show specific epigenome properties, expression regulation, variability and location in 3D chromatin structures that can be potentially altered in cancer and during differentiation. We identify consistent changes during oncogenesis in the spatial organization of genes from different evolutionary classes, correlated with changes in their expression variability across individuals, reinforcing the important role that old genes and their organization in the nucleus play in cancer phenotypes."},{"Session":"NetBio","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"12:10-12:30","Format":"Live-stream","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Mireya Diaz","Title":"Cytokine Module Dynamics during Respiratory Challenges among Pre-diabetic Individuals","Abstract":null},{"Session":"NetBio","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"13:50-14:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Enio Gjerga","Title":"Characterising Alternative Splicing Effects on Protein Interaction Networks with LINDA","Abstract":"Alternative RNA splicing plays a crucial role in defining protein function.

We have applied LINDA to a panel of 54 shRNA depletion experiments in HepG2 and K562 cells from the ENCORE initiative. Through computational benchmarking, we could show that the integration of splicing effects with LINDA can identify pathway mechanisms contributing to known bioprocesses better than other state of the art methods, which do not account for splicing. Additionally, we have experimentally validated some of the predicted splicing effects that the depletion of HNRNPK in K562 cells has on signalling.

Extracting subnetworks that represent well-studied pathways uncovers a hierarchical substructure that coincides with the compartmentalisation of glycolysis. The incompleteness of pathway annotation data raises the question whether we can build on the loss-of-function correlation network to refine these annotations. Using network propagation, specifically the well-established personalised PageRank algorithm, we identify genes that are in proximity to selected seed genes. We verify this approach with a cross-validation and outperform baseline ranking across a wide range of parameters.

To address these needs, we present Gemini, a novel network integration method that uses memory-efficient high-order pooling to represent and weight each network according to its uniqueness. Gemini then mitigates the uneven distribution through mixing up existing networks to create many new networks. We find that Gemini leads to more than a 10% improvement in F1 score, 14% improvement in micro-AUPRC, and 71% improvement in macro-AURPC for protein function prediction by integrating hundreds of networks from BioGRID, and that Gemini's performance significantly improves when more networks are added to the input network collection, while the comparison approach's performance deteriorates.

Biological network alignment (NA), which aims to find the node correspondence between species' protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, has been a popular strategy to uncover missing annotations by transferring functional knowledge across species. Traditional NA methods assumed that topologically similar proteins in PPIs are functionally similar. However, it was recently reported that functionally unrelated proteins can be as topologically similar as functionally related pairs, and a new data-driven or supervised NA paradigm has been proposed, which uses protein function data to discern which topological features correspond to functional relatedness. Here, we propose GraNA, a deep learning framework for the supervised NA paradigm. Employing graph neural networks, GraNA utilizes within-network interactions and across-network anchor links for learning protein representations and predicting functional correspondence between across-species proteins. A major strength of GraNA is its flexibility to integrate multi-faceted non-functional relationship data, such as sequence similarity and ortholog relationships, as anchor links to guide the mapping of functionally related proteins across species. Evaluating GraNA on a benchmark dataset composed of several NA tasks between different pairs of species, we observed that GraNA accurately predicted the functional relatedness of proteins and robustly transferred functional annotations across species, outperforming a number of existing NA methods. When applied to a case study on a humanized yeast network, GraNA also successfully discovered functionally replaceable human-yeast protein pairs that were documented in previous studies."},{"Session":"NetBio","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"16:20-16:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Joseph Szymborski","Title":"Accurate Cross-Species, Out-of-Distribution Predictions of Protein-Protein Interactions using Deep Learning","Abstract":null},{"Session":"NetBio","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"16:40-17:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Samuel Pastva","Title":"Trap spaces of multi-valued networks: Definition, computation, and applications","Abstract":null},{"Session":"NetBio","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"17:00-17:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Sara Mohammad-Taheri","Title":"Optimal adjustment sets for causal query estimation in partially observed biomolecular networks","Abstract":null},{"Session":"NetBio","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"17:20-18:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Desmond Higham","Title":"Triadic Closure and Bistability in Evolving Networks","Abstract":"In the study of social interaction networks, triadic closure describes the tendency for new friendships to form between individuals who already have friends in common. It has been argued heuristically that a triadic closure mechanism can lead to a bistability effect when large-scale social interaction networks evolve over time. Here, depending on the initial state and the transient dynamics, the system may evolve towards either of two long-time states. In this work, we propose and study a hierarchy of network evolution models that incorporate triadic closure. We use a chemical kinetics framework, paying careful attention to the reaction rate scaling with respect to the system size. In a macroscale regime, we show rigorously that a bimodal steady state distribution is admitted. This behaviour corresponds to the existence of two distinct stable fixed points in a deterministic mean-field ODE. The macroscale model is also seen to capture an apparent metastability property of the microscale system. Computational simulations will be used to support the analysis.

Many countries now have emerging personalized medicine programmes which are generating data from national or regional initiatives. Thus, human genomics is undergoing a step change from being a research-driven activity to one funded through healthcare initiatives. Genetic data generated in a healthcare context is subject to more stringent information governance than research data and often must comply with national legislation.

In this talk, we will describe how the Federated EGA - in the context of European initiatives such as the European Genomic Data Infrastructure and European Health Data Space - aims to deliver a global resource for discovery and access of sensitive human omics and associated data consented for secondary use, through a network of national human data repositories to accelerate disease research and improve human health."},{"Session":"NIH ODSS\/ELIXIR","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"14:30-14:50","Format":"Live-stream","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Ana Van Gulick","Title":"The Coopetition model of collaboration in the NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative","Abstract":null},{"Session":"NIH ODSS\/ELIXIR","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"14:50-15:10","Format":"Live-stream","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Obi Griffith","Title":"CIViC: Accelerating the expert-crowdsourcing of cancer variant interpretation","Abstract":"Precision oncology involves the use of prevention and treatment strategies tailored to the unique features of each individual cancer patient and their disease. The number of molecular alterations or ‚Äúvariants‚Äù identified as cancer drivers or linked to cancer prognosis, diagnosis, or drug response has exploded. As a result, cancer care-givers are faced with a deluge of patient-specific variants that must be interpreted in the context of a vast and growing biomedical literature describing their significance. Currently, these variant interpretations exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort. Widespread adoption of precision medicine requires this knowledge to be centralized, standardized and expert-curated for application in the clinic. To address this need, we created CIViC, a community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer, available online at civicdb.org. CIViC is uniquely distinguishable from other resources due to its fully open access, rich data model, and large community of volunteer expert curators. CIViC has been widely adopted by the community with many individual users, incorporated into numerous academic and commercial workflows, as the official curation platform for ClinGen Somatic variant curation, and as a Global Core Biodata Resource. Due to this widespread adoption, CIViC has seen a dramatic increase in the numbers of users integrating CIViC into their workflows and submissions of new content, which require expert moderation and review. This presentation will discuss recent efforts to accelerate dissemination of high-quality knowledge, automate biocuration and moderation, and engage in outreach, education and collaborative activities to support editor recruiting, training and incentivization."},{"Session":"NIH ODSS\/ELIXIR","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"15:10-15:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Laura Hughes","Title":"NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal: creating a federated search engine to discover infectious and immune-mediated disease data","Abstract":"The NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal is a searchable platform for Infectious and Immune-mediated Disease (IID) research that streamlines access to datasets from IID and generalist repositories ‚Äì creating a ‚ÄúPubMed for IID Datasets.‚Äù IID researchers are enthusiastic about sharing and using data, but IID datasets are difficult to find because searching across diverse data types (e.g., omics, immunological, clinical, etc.) is challenging, and IID data are often stored in repositories which use different data models, metadata standards, and data access protocols.

However, to date, the majority of supervised learning methods utilizing these data types did not take full advantage of the spatial information, impacting their performance and utilization. Taking inspiration from ecology and epidemiology, we developed novel spatial feature extraction methods for use with spatial proteomics data. We used these features to learn prediction models for cancer patient survival.

This implies that the drugs unexpectedly influence disease pathways. Then, discovering how biological effects of drugs relate to disease biology can both provide insight into the biological basis for latent drug effects, and can help predict new effects. Rich data now comprehensively profiles both biological processes impacted by common drugs, and human phenotypes known to be affected by these drugs. At the same time, systematic phenome-wide genetic studies have linked each common phenotype with putative disease driver genes. Here, we develop a supervised method that integrates in vitro data on 429 drugs and gene associations of 151 common phenotypes to learn how these molecular signals can explain drug effects on disease. Our predictions of drug-phenotype relationships outperform a baseline predictive model. But more importantly, by projecting each drug to the space of its influence on disease driver genes, we can propose the biological mechanism of unexpected effects of drugs on disease phenotypes. We present evidence that this model recovers known information about drug biology, supporting its potential to provide insights into the biology of unexpected effects of drugs on disease."},{"Session":"TransMed","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"12:00-12:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Pourya Naderi Yeganeh","Title":"iQPA: A functional phenotyping platform that mitigates risk of clinical failure in drug discovery by matching the underlying biological mechanism in laboratory models to human diseases","Abstract":"We present iQPA, an integrated quantitative pathway analysis platform that functionally matches modelled disease mechanisms with actual human diseases to improve drug discovery. It is challenging to evaluate how well a model system matches an actual human disease. iQPA integrates human tissue and model system transcriptomes to provide unequivocal functional phenotype matches. iQPA transforms gene expression into quantifiable pathway activities to determine pathway dysregulation. It assesses similarity by establishing a reference of common functional dysregulation between models and human. iQPA is applied to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, determining high-fidelity therapeutic target pathways. A cellular model with a high AŒ≤42\/40-ratio closely recapitulated human dysregulation events in the temporal cortex. Dysregulation events in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mouse models significantly correlated with human temporal cortex. iQPA identified 83 commonly dysregulated pathways with consistent dysregulation across human brains and the AŒ≤42\/40-high model. We validated commonly dysregulated pathways in the AŒ≤42\/4-high model, including the p38 MAPK pathway. A Clinical p38 MAPK inhibitor dramatically ameliorated AŒ≤-induced tau pathology and neuronal death in the matched AŒ≤42\/4-high model. iQPA guides targeting of the right pathogenic pathway in the right model.

We study the drug-drug interaction (DDI) phenomenon by analyzing drug administrations from population-wide Electronic Health Records (EHR) in Blumenau (Brazil), Catalonia (Spain), and Indianapolis (USA). Despite different health care systems and drug availability, we find a common large risk of DDI administration that affected 13 to 20% of individuals. In addition, DDI risk increases with aging but is not explained solely by higher co-administration rates in the elderly. We also find that women are at higher risk of DDI overall‚Äî except for men over 50 years old in Indianapolis. Finally, we show that PPI alternatives to Omeprazole can reduce the number of patients affected by known DDIs by up to 21% in both Blumenau and Catalonia, and 2% in Indianapolis, exemplifying how analysis of EHR data can lead to a significant reduction of DDI and its associated human and economic costs. Although the risk of DDIs increases with age, administration patterns point to a complex phenomenon that cannot be solely explained by polypharmacy and multimorbidity. The lack of safer drug alternatives further overburdens health systems, thus highlighting the need for disruptive drug research."},{"Session":"TransMed","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"12:20-12:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Annalise Schweickart","Title":"Delineating Drug Class and Target-Specific Adverse Events of Kinase Inhibitors","Abstract":null},{"Session":"TransMed","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"13:50-14:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"David Froelicher","Title":"Enabling collaborative analysis of genomic data silos with privacy","Abstract":null},{"Session":"TransMed","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"14:10-14:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Harry Robertson","Title":"Transferable Omics Prediction (TOP) Reveals Common Mechanisms of Allograft Rejection across Distinct Organs","Abstract":null},{"Session":"TransMed","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"14:30-14:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Florian Massip","Title":"Smoking-dependent expression alterations in nasal epithelium reveal immune impairment linked to germline variation and lung cancer risk","Abstract":null},{"Session":"TransMed","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Monday","Date":"July 24th","Timespan":"14:50-15:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Michelle Li","Title":"Deep learning for diagnosing patients with rare genetic diseases","Abstract":"There are more than 7,000 rare diseases, some affecting 3,500 or fewer patients in the US.

Once trained, we show that SHEPHERD can provide clinical insights about real-world patients. We evaluate SHEPHERD on a cohort of 465 patients representing 299 diseases in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. SHEPHERD excels at several diagnostic facets: performing causal gene discovery (causal genes are predicted at rank = 3.52 on average), retrieving ‚Äúpatients-like-me‚Äù with the same causal gene or disease, and providing interpretable characterizations of novel disease presentations.

But, common complex diseases are caused by many risk variants, and causal gene is not always clear. In contrast, Mendelian disease causal genes are well-known and druggable. Some Mendelian diseases are known to predispose patients to specific complex diseases (comorbidity), suggesting that they may share pathogenic processes. Here, we hypothesize that Mendelian and complex disease comorbidity can be used to find new drugs for the complex disease. From previous work, we examined 90 Mendelian and 65 complex diseases, finding 2,908 pairs of clinically associated (comorbid) diseases. Using this clinical signal, we match each complex disease to a set of relevant Mendelian disease genes and suggest that drugs targeting these genes may be successful for the complex disease. To test our hypothesis, we used data from clinical trials, known drug indications, and ATC categories level 3 and 4. After adjusting for the number of drug targets, we found significant enrichment of recommended drugs for repurposing among indicated and investigated drugs for cancer, hormonal and cardiovascular disease categories.

To help guide treatment decisions, we collected clinical and imaging (PET\/CT and PET\/MRI) biomarkers from 30 patients and identified those that are predictive of disease progression. The following radiological biomarkers were collected before and after neoadjuvant treatment: MRI Likert score, PET Likert score, PET maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), MRI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC¬¨), diffusion weighed imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE). The following clinical biomarkers were collected: tumor volume from pre-CHT MRI, pre and post-treatment prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, 3D prostate volume, and PSA density (PSAd); and PSA change from pre to post-treatment. Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression, we observe that post-treatment SUVmax is predictive of disease progression (p=1e-6), as is tumor volume (p=2e-6), pre and post-treatment PSA levels (p=1e-4), and PSA change (p=4e-4). The combination of SUVmax and tumor volume is the most predictive combination of biomarkers (p=5e-8), and is more predictive than either biomarker individually.

To address this, we introduce SpatialDM, a statistical model and Spatial transcriptomic toolbox that uses a bivariant Moran's statistic to detect spatially co-expressed ligand and receptor pairs in spatial transcriptomics data. Unlike other methods, SpatialDM does not require pre-annotation of cell types and can detect local interacting spots and patterns. This method is scalable and has shown accurate and robust performance in multiple simulations. With an analytically derived z-score approach, SpatialDM only takes 12 min for a million-spot data and a few seconds for the most prevalent thousand-spot datasets. SpatialDM achieves a highest of 0.959 AUROC under various simulation settings whereas other methods range from 0.563 to 0.871. SpatialDM has been applied to melanoma and intestinal datasets of different sequencing platforms, where it has identified well-known communication patterns, promising tumor microenvironment insights, and differential interactions between conditions, thereby enabling context-specific cell interaction discovery.

First, longitudinal cognitive scores of 210 dementia patients were used to create fast and slow progression groups. Second, we trained ML classifiers on CSF proteomic profiles and obtained a well-performing prediction model (ROC-AUC = 0.82). Lastly, we explored the potential for each of the 20 top candidates in internal sensitivity analyses. TNFRSF4 and TGF Œ≤-1 emerged as the top markers, being lower in fast-progressing patients compared to slow-progressing patients. Proteins of which a low concentration was associated with fast progression were enriched for cell signalling and immune response pathways. None of our top markers stood out as strong individual predictors of subsequent cognitive decline.

Compared to different computational approaches, methods that employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, offer good predictive performance when compared to experimental measurements, but are computationally demanding. In contrast, Surfaces, which uses a complementarity function (CF) based on atomic areas in contact, offers comparable performance with reduced computational cost, making large-scale applications feasible. Surfaces was applied to analyze a dataset of 738 structures of Spike protein in complex with antibodies and mutations in complex with the receptor ACE2. The results of Surfaces provide insights into the contribution of individual residue-residue interactions to receptor binding and immune escape. In conclusion, Surfaces offers a simplified and effective approach for evaluating protein interfaces and understanding per-residue interaction contributions, making it a valuable tool for large-scale applications, including the study of viral glycoprotein evolution, particularly relevant in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"13:50-14:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"Rafael Najmanovich","Title":"3DSIG: Past, Present and Future (Part II)","Abstract":"3DSIG has come a long way since its start as a satellite meeting.

The recent Foldseek method of van Kempen et al. encodes the structural information from the distances and angles along the protein backbone into a linear string using tokens from a 21 letter discretized structural alphabet, of the same length as the protein string. We show that when structural data is available, so that the Foldseek string can be efficiently produced, when it is offered as an additional input to our recent Topsy-Turvy deep-learning method that predicts PPIs cross-species solely from a pair of protein amino acid sequences, performance substantially improves. Thus our new method, TT3D, presents a way to reuse all the computational effort going into producing high-quality structural models from sequence, which is sufficiently lightweight so that high-quality binary PPI predictions across all protein pairs can be made genome-wide."},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"14:20-14:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Alex Morehead","Title":"A Gated Graph Transformer for Protein Complex Structure Quality Assessment and its Performance in CASP15","Abstract":null},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"14:40-15:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Juami van Gils","Title":"Disordered flanks slow down the growth of amyloid fibrils in neurodegenerative disease, while hydrophobic surfaces accelerate growth","Abstract":null},{"Session":"3D-SIG","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"16:00-16:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Yunzhuo Zhou","Title":"DDMut: predicting effects of mutations on protein stability using deep learning","Abstract":"Understanding the effects of mutations on protein stability is crucial for variant interpretation and prioritisation, protein engineering, and biotechnology.

To fill this gap, we developed DDMut, a fast and accurate siamese network to predict changes in Gibbs Free Energy upon single and multiple point mutations, leveraging both forward and hypothetical reverse mutations to account for model anti-symmetry. Deep learning models were built by integrating graph-based representations of the localised 3D environment, with convolutional layers and transformer encoders. This combination better captured the distance patterns between atoms by extracting both short-range and long-range interactions. DDMut achieved Pearson's correlations of up to 0.70 (RMSE: 1.37‚Äâkcal\/mol) on single point mutations, and 0.70 (RMSE: 1.84‚Äâkcal\/mol) on double\/triple mutations, outperforming most available methods across non-redundant blind test sets. Importantly, DDMut was highly scalable and demonstrated anti-symmetric performance on both destabilising and stabilising mutations.

Engineering flexibility is one of the last frontiers in protein design: the implications of mutations in flexibility are yet not well understood. Cryptic relationships among distant residues (allostery) and the lack of a flexibility functional unit definition are reasons for this hardship. We recently engaged in this exciting field by showcasing and generalising the process of exchanging loops (dynamic structural elements) between homologous proteins, transferring the dynamic behaviour from one protein to another as result. To this end, we designed LoopGrafter (https:\/\/loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz\/loopgrafter\/, doi: 10.1093\/nar\/gkac249), a web server that provides a step-by-step interactive procedure where the user can successively identify loops in the input proteins, calculate their geometries, similarities and dynamics, and select loops to be transplanted.

We model the joint distribution of the observed mainchain and sidechain dihedral angles (<œÜ,œà,œá1,œá2,...>) of any amino acid by a mixture of a product of von Mises probability distributions. This mixture model maps any vector of dihedral angles to a point on a multi-dimensional torus. The continuous space it uses to specify the dihedral angles provides an alternative to the commonly-used rotamer libraries. These rotamer libraries discretize the space of dihedral angles into coarse angular bins, and cluster combinations of sidechain dihedral angles (<œá1,œá2,...>) as a function of backbone <œÜ,œà> conformations. A ‚Äògood‚Äò model is one that is both concise and explains (compresses) observed data. Competing models can be compared directly and in particular our model is shown to outperform the Dunbrack rotamer library in terms of model-complexity (by three-orders of magnitude) and its fidelity (on average 20% more compression) when losslessly explaining the observed dihedral angle data across experimental resolutions of structures. Our method is unsupervised (with parameters estimated automatically) and uses information-theory to determine the optimal complexity of the statistical model, thus avoiding under\/over-fitting, a common pitfall in model-selection problems.

These proteins are structurally dynamic and can adopt different conformational states, including active and inactive states. The positioning of c-helix and DFG structural elements defines these states, which maintain cellular homeostasis. Kinase inhibitors (KIs) exhibit different biophysical, biochemical, and pharmacophore properties depending on the specific kinase conformation they target. The recent success of AlphaFold2 (AF2) in predicting protein structures accurately based on sequence inspired our investigation into the conformational landscape of protein kinases modeled by AF2. Our research demonstrated that AF2 can accurately model several kinase conformations across the kinome in a kinase-specific manner. However, it is challenging to direct AF2 to generate structures of kinases in specific conformational states. This lack of conformational coverage hinders the discovery of novel conformation specific KIs, especially for kinases lacking experimental structures. We present a new methodology that utilizes ColabFold, an open-source protein modeling software based on AF2, to model any kinase in the active conformation.

Only 280 of these kinases are currently represented in the PDB. The active form of the kinase must satisfy requirements for binding ATP, magnesium, and substrate. From bioinformatics analysis of structures of 40 unique substrate-bound kinases, as well as many structures with bound ATP and phosphorylated activation loops, we derived criteria for the active form of protein kinases. These criteria include the conformation of the DFG motif (in dihedral angles) and the N-terminal domain salt bridge, required for binding ATP and magnesium. There are also novel requirements on the position of the N and C terminal portions of the activation loop, which lead to the formation of a substrate binding cleft. With these criteria, only 148 of 438 kinase domains (32%) are present in the PDB. We used extensive sampling with AlphaFold2 with these active-state structures as templates and shallow multiple sequence alignments to make active-conformation models of all 438 human kinases. In addition, we used active models produced by AlphaFold2 as templates for modeling recalcitrant kinases (\"diffusion templates\"). Models of all 438 catalytically competent kinases in the active form are available at http:\/\/dunbrack.fccc.edu\/kincore\/active).

Interpretability is provided for such models either extrinsically by determining feature importance for predictions, or intrinsically through inspecting model internal parameters such as Transformer attention weights.

By leveraging sophisticated analysis tools such as persistent homology and simplicial complexes, including the Vietoris Rips Complex, we obtain a highly precise modeling of the ECG data, enabling us to distinguish between the ECG data of patients suffering from these debilitating illnesses from healthy individuals. Our novel approach involves extracting critical geometric features from the persistence diagrams and images obtained from our persistent homologies of the patient ECG data. These features are then input into an algorithm based on our topological data analysis, enabling us to classify, with virtually complete accuracy, which of these three conditions a patient is suffering from.

Such networks have the potential to display incompatibilities among the input trees. However, interpreting those networks can be challenging due to the significant number of nodes and edges and their non-planar structure. Here, we present the new concept of a phylogenetic consensus outline which is a new type of network but is significantly less complex than previous ones. We introduce an efficient algorithm for its computation. The main idea is to use a PQ-tree data structure to decide which splits to keep in the consensus. This consensus uses a phylogenetic outline for visualization. A phylogenetic outline is a network that represents a set of circular splits as an outer-labeled planar graph.

Some tools also generate plots to visualise the predicted interactions but these are not consistent across tools and since most datasets include several cell populations, visualisation can be challenging.

While effective, reference-based translocation detection may generate false positive calls tied to polymorphic insertions. In this work we show that augmented genome sequence graphs, that contain known variation not found in the linear reference genome, can be used to effectively detect chromosomal translocations with far fewer false positive calls and in less time than existing state of the art methods.

First, using a statistical model, we identify relevant signals from cancer mutations based on a mutational signature reference catalog (e.g., COSMIC [2]).

In this study, we demonstrate that a quantitative treatment of scATAC-seq data improves the goodness-of-fit of existing models and their applications, including clustering, cell type identification, and batch integration. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that fragment counts, but not read counts, can be modeled using standard count distributions. Second, we compare the effects of binarization versus a count-based model (PoissonVAE) on scATAC-seq data using publicly available datasets and highlight the biological effects that are missed by a binary treatment. We show that high count peaks in scATAC-seq data correspond to important regulatory regions such as super-enhancers and highly transcribed promoters, similar to observations in bulk ATAC-seq data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fragment counts in promoter regions correlate with gene expression, emphasizing a quantitative signal in promoter accessibility.

Traditionally, short read aligners---such as Bowtie and BWA---were used to index a single reference genome, which was then used to find approximate alignments of reads to that genome. Unfortunately, these methods can only index a small number of genomes. Moni, an emerging pangenomic aligner, uses a preprocessing technique called prefix-free parsing to build a dictionary and parse from the input---these, in turn, are used to build the main run-length encoded BWT, and suffix array of the input. This is accomplished in linear space in the size of the dictionary and parse. Therein lies the open problem that we tackle in this paper. Although the dictionary scales sub-linearly with the size of the input, the parse becomes orders of magnitude larger than the dictionary. To scale the construction of Moni, we need to remove the parse from the construction of the RLBWT and suffix array. We solve this problem, and demonstrate that this improves the construction time and memory requirement allowing us to build the RLBWT and suffix array for 1000 diploid human haplotypes from the 1000 genomes project using less than 600GB of memory."},{"Session":"HiTSeq","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"17:00-17:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Hartmut H√§ntze","Title":"Effects of Spaced k-mers on Alignment-Free Genotyping","Abstract":null},{"Session":"HiTSeq","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"17:20-17:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Mingfu Shao","Title":"Seeding with Minimized Subsequence","Abstract":"Modern methods for computation-intensive tasks in sequence analysis (e.g., read mapping, sequence alignment, genome assembly, etc.) often first transform each sequence into a list of short, regular-length seeds so that compact data structures and efficient algorithms can be employed to handle the ever-growing large-scale data. Seeding methods using kmers have gained tremendous success in processing sequencing data with low mutation\/error rates. However, they are much less effective for sequencing data with high error rates as kmers cannot tolerate errors. We propose SubseqHash, a strategy that uses subsequences, rather than substrings, as seeds. Formally, SubseqHash maps a string of length n to its smallest subsequence of length k, k < n, according to a given order over all length-k strings. Finding the smallest subsequence of a string by enumeration is impractical as the number of subsequences grows exponentially. To overcome this barrier, we propose a novel algorithmic framework that consists of a specifically designed order (termed ABC order) and an algorithm that computes the minimized subsequence under an ABC order in polynomial time. We first show that the ABC order exhibits the desired property and the probability of hash collision using the ABC order is close to a theoretical upper bound. We then show that SubseqHash overwhelmingly outperforms the substring-based seeding methods in producing high-quality seeds for three critical applications: read mapping, sequence alignment, and overlap detection. SubseqHash presents a major algorithmic breakthrough for tackling the high error rates and we expect it to be widely adapted for long-reads analysis."},{"Session":"HiTSeq","Room":"Salle Saint Claire 3","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"17:40-18:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Antoine Limasset","Title":"Scalable sequence database search using Partitioned Aggregated Bloom Comb-Trees","Abstract":null},{"Session":"MICROBIOME","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"10:30-11:15","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Karoline Faust","Title":"From hairballs to hypotheses: network analysis applied to microbiome data","Abstract":"In recent years, the microbial composition of a large number of samples has been resolved through sequencing, thereby enabling microbial network inference and analysis.

Metagenomic binning refers to the clustering of genomic subsequences obtained from high-throughput DNA sequencing into distinct bins, each corresponding to a constituent organism in the community. In contrast to the earlier methods using the composition and abundance of sequences, certain graph-based binning tools have been proposed that leverage homophily information from the assembly graph. However, the binning problem is exacerbated by fragment-level assembly graph, heterophilous constraints from single-copy marker genes, unknown binning numbers, and skewed bin size distribution. In this paper, we formulate metagenomic binning as a combination of graph learning and constraint satisfaction problems and design a reference-free binning tool, NeuroBin, which involves (i) a graph neural network model to learn the fragment-level assembly graph meanwhile respecting constraints, (ii) a constrained-contigs matching algorithm to generate initial bins with an accurate count, (iii) a neural network-based combinatorial optimization model to minimize the constraints violated by binning, and (iv) a local refinement strategy to adjust binning results. Extensive experiments conducted on simulated datasets demonstrate that NeuroBin surpasses the state-of-the-art binning methods based on the assembly graph."},{"Session":"MICROBIOME","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"14:35-14:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Xubo Tang","Title":"Identifying plasmid contigs from metagenomic data using Transformer","Abstract":null},{"Session":"MICROBIOME","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"14:50-15:05","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Ataberk Donmez","Title":"stRainy: assembly-based metagenomic strain phasing using long reads","Abstract":"Bacterial species in microbial communities are often represented by mixtures of strains. Variation in strain genomes may have important phenotypic effects, however strain-level deconvolution of microbial communities remains challenging. Short-read approaches can be used to detect small-scale variation between strains, but fail to phase these variants into contiguous haplotypes. Recent advances in long-read metagenomics resulted in complete de novo assemblies of various bacterial species. However, current assembly approaches often suppress strain-level variation, and instead produce species-level consensus representation. Strain variants are often unevenly distributed, and regions of high and low heterozygosity may interleave in the assembly graph, resulting in tangles. To address this, we developed an algorithm for metagenomic phasing and assembly called stRainy. Our approach takes a sequence graph as input, identifies graph regions that represent collapsed strains, phases them and represents the results in an expanded and simplified assembly graph. We benchmark stRainy using simulated data and mock metagenomic communities with both PacBio HiFi and Oxford Nanopore reads and show that it achieves strain-level deconvolution with high completeness and low error rates, compared to the other strain assembly and phasing approaches."},{"Session":"MICROBIOME","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"15:05-15:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Roland Faure","Title":"HairSplitter: separating similar strains in metagenome assemblies","Abstract":"Long-read assemblers struggle to distinguish between closely related strains and therefore tend to collapse them into a single sequence.

Such analysis involves searching for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within the genome of an organism to identify genes responsible for the production of natural products. Bacteria and fungi are particularly attractive targets for genome mining due to their high genetic diversity and ability to produce a wide range of bioactive compounds. Microbial genomes are relatively small compared to higher eukaryotes, making them easier to sequence and analyze. In the pre-genomic era, a limited number of microbes were studied for drug discovery. The growing availability of genomic data has led to a significant increase in the number of novel BGCs identified through genome sequence mining. The limited computational methods for prioritization, as well as a lack of comparison across virulence risk classes of species (e.g. COGEM), have created challenges for further understanding and identification of species.

The actionability is enabled by incorporating the Hill equation into SynBa, so that the parameters representing the potency and the efficacy can be preserved.

The functions of G-quadruplexes are linked to various molecular and disease phenotypes, and thus researchers are interested in measuring G-quadruplex formation genome-wide. Experimentally measuring G-quadruplexes is a long and laborious process. Computational prediction of G-quadruplex propensity from a given DNA sequence is thus a long-standing challenge. Unfortunately, despite the availability of high-throughput datasets measuring G-quadruplex propensity in the form of mismatch scores, extant methods to predict G-quadruplex formation either rely on small datasets or are based on domain-knowledge rules. We developed G4mismatch, a novel algorithm to accurately and efficiently predict G-quadruplex propensity for any genomic sequence. G4mismatch is based on a convolutional neural network trained on millions human genomic loci measured in a single G4-seq experiment.

However, a major limitation of current methods is that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post-hoc analyses, and even then we often cannot explain the internal mechanics of highly parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called tiSFM (totally interpretable sequence to function model). tiSFM improves upon the performance of standard multi-layer convolutional models while using fewer parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multi-layer neural network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of relevant sequence motifs. Results: tiSFM‚Äôs model architecture makes use of convolutions with a fixed set of kernel weights representing known transcription factor (TF) binding site motifs. Analyzing published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic lineage cell types we demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show that it correctly identifies context specific activities of transcription factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM‚Äôs model parameters have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a function developmental transition."},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Tuesday","Date":"July 25th","Timespan":"13:50-14:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Caroline Uhler","Title":"Causal Representation Learning in the Context of Gene Regulation","Abstract":"The development of CRISPR-based assays and small molecule screens holds the promise of engineering precise cell state transitions to move cells from one cell type to another or from a diseased state to a healthy state.

Prior studies have primarily interrogated single loci rather than examining genome-wide interactions between enhancers and have reached inconsistent conclusions about synergistic effects between enhancers. To interrogate interactions between enhancers on a genome-wide scale, we reanalyzed a single-cell CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen that delivered random combinations of guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting putative enhancers to each cell. Using negative binomial generalized linear models (GLMs), we first improved the modeling of enhancer-gene interactions by accounting for variable gRNA efficiencies. We then queried interaction effects between enhancers by modeling 3,808 enhancer pairs throughout the genome where both enhancers were located within 1MB of a common target gene. We found no evidence of strong interaction effects between pairs of enhancers acting on the same gene using this dataset. Rather, the data support a model where the effects of multiple enhancers combine multiplicatively to regulate their target genes.

Our study identifies phages as the most critical block of variables, while environmental factors known to contribute to ARG spread are among the globally important variables. This underscores the need for further investigation into the role of phages and suggests that other variables may act as confounders. We control for the effect of environmental factors and model the phage abundances on ARG abundances for several antibiotic classes.

Lab mice (Mus musculus) are crucial for in-vivo research and constitute most non-human vertebrate data. The IMGT database's completeness in representing diverse mice strains is unclear, leading to disparities in the representation of different strains in immunogenetics databases. We assessed the IMGT database's representation of four lab mice strains (C57BL6, C57BL6\/J, BALB\/c, and NOD) by analyzing 181 TCR-seq samples from the SRA using MiXCR software. MiXCR aligns TCR reads to the IMGT database and compares them to the reference reads. Results revealed that C57BL\/6 mice are more representative of the V gene in the IMGT database (0.66 ¬± 8.71), while BALB\/c mice are more representative of J gene (0.08 ¬± 1.58). Our study represents the first study to comprehensively evaluate the completeness of the IMGT database for diverse mice strains, and demonstrate that the database is severely incomplete for various mice strains and provide appealing evidence for the urgent need to diversify the databases. We identify underrepresented mice strains in the database and emphasize the importance of diverse immunogenetics databases for understanding the immune responses in different mouse strains."},{"Session":"CAMDA","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"17:40-17:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Elodine Coquelet","Title":"Data Lakehouse to support the developpement of AI models for predicting patient clinical response to targeted and immuno-therapies","Abstract":null},{"Session":"CAMDA","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"17:50-18:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"Wenzhong Xiao","Title":"Day 1 closing remarks","Abstract":null},{"Session":"Education","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"10:30-11:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Eija Korpelainen","Title":"Managing rapidly evolving training needs in the single-cell and spatial era","Abstract":null},{"Session":"Education","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"11:10-11:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Marta Lloret-Llinares","Title":"The PerMedCoE training programme: building capacity in personalised medicine","Abstract":null},{"Session":"Education","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"11:30-11:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Sofia Fertuzinhos","Title":"Bridging the Knowledge Gap: The Evolving Role of the Bioinformatics Support Hub in Facilitating Access to -Omics Data Analysis","Abstract":"The generation, analysis, and interpretation of -omics data have become essential in modern biological research, but many researchers lack the necessary computational skills.

However, despite a variety of educational efforts, learning to write code can be a challenging endeavor for both researchers and students in life science disciplines. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it possible to translate human-language prompts to functional code, raising questions about whether these technologies can aid (or replace) life scientists' efforts to write code. Using 184 programming exercises from an introductory-bioinformatics course, we evaluated the extent to which one such model‚ÄîOpenAI's ChatGPT‚Äîcan successfully complete basic- to moderate-level programming tasks. On its first attempt, ChatGPT solved 139 (75.5%) of the exercises. For the remaining exercises, we provided natural-language feedback to the model, prompting it to try different approaches. Within 7 or fewer attempts, ChatGPT solved 179 (97.3%) of the exercises. These findings have important implications for life-sciences research and education. For many programming tasks, researchers no longer need to write code from scratch. Instead, machine-learning models may produce usable solutions.

First, they should use methods that address sources of bias common to many phylogenetic datasets. Second, they should be robust to multiple sequence alignment error. Bias in phylogenetic estimation can reflect issues like long-branch attraction, but a major source of bias in phylogenomics is discordance among gene trees due to processes like incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Distance-based phylogenetic methods can be a consistent estimator of the species tree under these conditions, raising the possibility that alignment-free distance methods could solve the challenges associated with ILS along and multiple sequence alignment error. Alignment-free approaches that calculate distances using conditional Kolmogorov complexity of the genome (or proteome) of one organism given the genome (or proteome) of another organism have been suggested but have received limited use in empirical studies. This reflects the fact that: 1) models of sequence evolution cannot be incorporated into the methods; and 2) it is difficult to estimating clade support using these methods. Herein, I provide a way to incorporate information about patterns of protein sequence evolution and estimate clade support similar to the bootstrap. The utility of this modified alignment-free distance method was demonstrated using empirical phylogenies of mammals and birds."},{"Session":"EvolCompGen","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"11:30-11:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Ricardo C.

Recombination suppression leads to genomic degeneration due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations and transposable elements (TEs), which in turn can promote structural rearrangements. The dynamics of genomic degeneration after the onset of recombination suppression are largely unknown. Here we investigated the accumulation of deleterious mutations, TEs and structural rearrangements over time, leveraging on 22 independent events of recombination suppression identified on mating-type chromosomes of anther-smut fungi. We estimated degeneration levels in non-recombining regions spanning more than four million years of evolution. After controlling for differences in GC-biased gene conversion, ancestral expression and TEs epigenetic and mutational inactivation, we found that following recombination suppression: i) the frequency of optimal codons rapidly decreased, ii) the strength of purifying selection remained constant at an intermediate level between purifying selection and neutral evolution, iii) rapid initial TEs accumulation is followed by a slow down in later stages, iv) non-recombining regions serve as a reservoir of TEs that can then transpose to recombining regions and are involved in structural rearrangements. Our study sheds light on the processes underpinning the degeneration of non-recombining regions and its genome-wide consequences."},{"Session":"EvolCompGen","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"11:50-12:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Giulia Sassi","Title":"Fast and performant pipeline for coevolutionary analysis of eukaryotic genes","Abstract":"Coevolution can be used to predict gene function, as in the case of phylogenetic profiling (PP) methods.

Cotr analysis can find coevolutionary associations even among genes with low profile similarity.

We then investigated their evolutionary history through phylostratigraphy approaches. Doing so, we showed that 406 lineage-specific enzyme activities were already present in fungal ancestors and subsequently lost during evolution. Moreover, 50 were novel fungal-specific enzyme activities. Regarding their location in the metabolic network, we showed that the enzyme activities associated with specific clades and species are mostly peripheral, less connected, and alternatives to common ones.

Systematically Identifying cancer-protecting genetic variations is almost impossible in the human population. It needs massive genomic and clinical data that are currently very limited. However, there are notable differences in the cancer rates among different animal species where some display almost total immunity to the disease. Through the utilization of comparative genomics, we identify genetic variants that are distinctive to cancer resistance rodents and predict cancer risk across mammals. In the human population, we identify 1,000 Resistant Alleles (SNPs) with lower prevalence among cancer patients. We validated two R-Alleles and show reduced cancerous characteristics in cancer cell cultures, with no noticeable phenotypic changes in healthy human cell cultures. Overall, we generated a cross-species map of R-alleles that are correlated with cancer resistance across various species.

C.auris clinical strains exhibit clade- specific features associated with virulence and drug resistance. The molecular events leading to the rapid emergence are yet to be understood. Here, chromosomal rearrangements among C.auris clades and related species are investigated with primary focus on centromeres, to understand its evolutionary trajectory. Centromeres, known to be the hotspots of breaks and downstream rearrangements are identified using a combined approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation and comparative genomic analysis. We find that C.auris and multiple other species in the Clavispora\/Candida clade share a conserved small regional GC poor centromeric landscape that lack in pericentromeres and repeats. A centromere inactivation event has led to karyotypic alterations in the species complex. It is observed that one of the geographical clades, the East Asian Clade, has evolved along a unique trajectory compared to other clades and related species. Consequent to this rapid evolution, recently reported strains are indicating cross identification within the previously defined four distinct geographical clades.

Modern phylogenomic analyses often use methods that account for the heterogeneity of evolutionary histories across the genome due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. However, these methods typically do not generate branch lengths in units that are usable by downstream applications, forcing phylogenomic analyses to resort to alternative shortcuts such as estimating branch lengths by concatenating gene alignments into a supermatrix. Yet, concatenation and other available approaches for estimating branch lengths fail to address heterogeneity across the genome. In this paper, we derive expected values of gene tree branch lengths in substitution units under an extension of the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model that allows substitutions with varying rates across the species tree.

LncRNAs are able to interact with other RNAs, DNA, peptides or proteins. Here, we focused on RNA:DNA interactions (R-loops) which can be studied by DRIP-seq based on the S9.6 antibody's high affinity for R-loops. Based on more than 120 DRIP-seq experiments and lncRNA annotation, we were able to show that 49% of lncRNAs are likely to form a cis-R-loop. We have also identified 1367 lncRNA\/coding gene pairs for which we suspect a role for the lncRNA in regulating the expression of the nearby coding gene. The VIM\/VIM-AS1 pair, a well-known case described by Boque-Sastre et al., is also retrieved. These initial results are very promising; they will require experimental validations in the coming years.

Using the PHROGs database of categorically annotated viral protein families, we trained a functional classifier that achieved an average area under the precision recall curve of 0.62 across nine functions over five train-test splits. The classifier was further validated by achieving 67% accuracy on a reannotation of 57 PHROG families. Additionally, PLM representations capture protein functional properties specific to viruses. Families with functions related to phage virion structure and lysis separate in the embedded space from families with functions related to viral genome replication, host genome integration, and host associated genes. To highlight the potential of PLMs to identify function annotations inaccessible to current approaches, we used a PLM-based functional classifier to identify a novel tyrosine recombinase in the ocean microbiome.

Accurate calling of small variants (eg., single-nucleotide variants [SNVs]) is a critical prerequisite for many downstream analyses but call sets from scDNA-seq data often contain many false positives (‚Äòartifacts‚Äô). We introduce ArtiCull, a variant call refinement algorithm that exploits evolutionary constraints to identify artifacts in scDNA-seq data. ArtiCull requires no external training data, manual inspection, or prior knowledge of artifact profiles. Instead, ArtiCull uses somatic evolutionary models to identify a subset of high-confidence artifactual and true variants; these labeled variants are then used to train a feature-based classifier.

However, it has limitations in measuring changes in gene expression during dynamic biological processes such as differentiation due to the destruction of cells during analysis. Recent studies combining scRNA-seq with lineage tracing have provided clonal information but still face challenges such as observations at discrete time points and difficulty in tracking cells within a certain lineage over the time course, since early observations are not direct ancestors of cells in the same lineage observed later time point. To address these issues, we developed Lineage Variational Inference (LineageVI), a model based on the framework of variational autoencoder (VAE), to convert single-cell transcriptome observation with DNA barcoding into the latent state dynamics consistent with the clonal relationship by assuming a common ancestor. This model enables us to quantitatively capture the cell state transitions. We demonstrate how our model can recapitulate differentiation trajectories in hematopoiesis and learn potential dynamics and estimated backward transitions from later to earlier observations in the latent space. Restoring transcriptomes at each time point in each lineage showed an increase in undifferentiated marker expression and a decrease in differentiation marker expression according to ancestors."},{"Session":"HiTSeq","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"16:20-16:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Alice Lacan","Title":"GAN-based Data Augmentation for Transcriptomics: Survey and Comparative Assessment","Abstract":null},{"Session":"HiTSeq","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"16:40-17:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Mikaela Koutrouli","Title":"Visualizing Spatial Transcriptomics with U-CIE Color Encoding","Abstract":"Spatial transcriptomics is a cutting-edge technique that enables the analysis of gene expression patterns within specific regions of tissue or organs. However, analyzing the large and complex datasets generated from spatial transcriptomics experiments remains a challenge. Here we propose U-CIE, a method for visualizing high-dimensional data by encoding it as colors using a combination of dimensionality reduction and the CIELAB color space. U-CIE allows genome-wide expression patterns within tissue or organ sections to be visualized and highlights the distribution of different cell types across the spatial transcriptomics data. U-CIE first uses UMAP to reduce high-dimensional gene expression data to three dimensions while preserving the spatial information. Next, the resulting three-dimensional representation is embedded within the CIELAB color space, generating a color encoding that captures much of the original structure of the data. U-CIE has been successfully applied to a mouse brain section dataset to highlight the distribution of different cell types across the spatial transcriptomics data and provide insights into the organization of these cells within brain regions. U-CIE has the potential to be a powerful tool for exploring spatial transcriptomics data and gaining new insights into cellular organization and function."},{"Session":"HiTSeq","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"17:00-17:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Corentin Thuilliez","Title":"CellFromSpace: A versatile tool for spatial transcriptomic data analysis through reference-free deconvolution and guided cell type\/activity annotation","Abstract":null},{"Session":"HiTSeq","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"17:20-17:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Michael P Lynch","Title":"demuxSNP: supervised demultiplexing of scRNAseq data using cell hashing and SNPs","Abstract":null},{"Session":"HiTSeq","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"17:40-18:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Asia Mendelevich","Title":"Foreign RNA spike-ins enable accurate allele-specific expression analysis at scale","Abstract":null},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"10:30-10:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"Michelle Scott","Title":"Introduction to iRNA COSI session","Abstract":null},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"10:40-11:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Irmtraud Meyer","Title":"Methods for investigating the dancing transcriptome","Abstract":"Many computational studies assume a rather static view of the transcriptome.

The strength of an interaction is quantitatively described by its equilibrium dissociation constant, the substrate concentration required for half-maximal complex formation. Interactions with the same affinity may arise from different kinetic behaviors that may vary by orders of magnitude: one set of interactions may be driven by rapid recognition and binding, while another may be driven by slower association but increased complex stability. Thus, the affinities and the dynamics of molecular interaction provide critical information for developing quantitative models of a regulatory network. RBNS determines the specificity of proteins for nucleic acids in vitro using a single-step binding assay and a high-throughput sequencing readout, making the method widely accessible and cost-effective. Here, we present an analytical strategy to estimate absolute binding affinities from RBNS data, extend RBNS to kinetic studies, and develop a framework to compute relative association and dissociation rate constants. Using these approaches, we have begun to define quantitative targeting rules for individual microRNAs (miRNAs) bound to mammalian Argonaute proteins.

However, the human genome produces numerous orphan SNORDs that lack the ability to interact with classical RNA targets and whose function is poorly understood. The eutherian-specific, orphan SNORD116 genes, which are organized in a large tandem repeat at 15q11-13, are strongly suspected to play a major role in the rare disease called Prader Willi syndrome (PWS), but their molecular function remains unknown. We combined phylogenetic and computational interaction analyses to reveal that a subset of snord116 copies use an antisense element, which is typically involved in classical target recognition, to interact with messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Target status was confirmed by transient knockdown and compensation experiments in human and mouse cells. To go further, we are working to characterize the molecular mechanism of snord116 action and to identify the extent of their target repertoire. This combination of computational and experimental approaches expands the description of the molecular bases of PWS and opens new avenues for therapy. More generally, this approach could be considered for the functional characterization of other noncoding RNAs, in particular when expressed from multiple gene copies."},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"15:20-15:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"Multiple Authors","Title":"Poster flash talks","Abstract":null},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"16:00-16:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Julien Gagneur","Title":"Calling and predicting aberrant splicing","Abstract":"Genetic variants causing aberrant splicing is a major cause of genetic disorders.

However, some TSSs cannot be associated with known annotated genes, thus called orphan TSSs. Hence, characterizing transcripts starting at these positions seems to be challenging for existing computational annotation pipelines. TSS-Captur, a novel pipeline, uses different computational approaches to characterize transcripts starting from experimentally confirmed orphan TSSs with a specific focus on non-coding RNA gene characterization. TSS-Captur uses two methods to classify extracted transcripts into coding or non-coding genes and predicts for each putative transcript their transcription termination sites. For each predicted ncRNA gene, the secondary structure is computed. Furthermore, putative promoter regions are analyzed for the existence of known transcription regulation motifs. The results are presented in an interactive interface for easy exploration. TSS-Captur was tested on Streptomyces coelicolor data and successfully characterized unlabeled ncRNAs overlooked by common genome annotation pipelines. Also, TSS-Captur characterized more unannotated transcripts in greater detail when compared to another similar pipeline. In summary, starting from experimental TSS data, TSS-Captur predicts the characterization of unclassified signals and complements prokaryotic annotation tools, contributing to the understanding of bacterial transcriptomes."},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"17:10-17:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"Multiple Authors","Title":"Poster flash talks","Abstract":null},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"17:30-18:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":null,"Title":"Extra time for poster viewing","Abstract":null},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"10:30-11:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Mikhail Spivakov","Title":"Probing the relationship between enhancer activity, connectivity, and gene expression","Abstract":null},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"11:10-11:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Vipin Kumar","Title":"BootTHiC: Integrating HiC and transcriptomics to detect transcriptional hubs","Abstract":null},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"11:30-11:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Aayush Grover","Title":"UniversalEPI: An Attention-based Method to Predict Chromatin Interactions in Unseen and Rare Cell Types","Abstract":"Non-coding mutations represent more than 95% of all cancer variants. Most of these variants do not affect the transcription rate of proximal genes and are therefore overlooked in cancer studies. However, a small proportion of non-coding variants may have vast consequences on gene regulation through modifications in the structure of chromatin and\/or modulation of proximal and distal regulatory elements. Therefore, prediction of the chromatin structure in a specific tissue or cancer type is an important task and is crucial for our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer development and progression. While several methods have been shown to accurately predict the chromatin structure for a given cell type, little focus has been given to being able to predict the chromatin structure in unseen cell types. Here, we propose an attention-based deep neural model, called UniversalEPI, that can accurately predict the interactions between regulatory elements in an unseen cell type. We show that UniversalEPI captures transcription factors that are important for chromatin organization accurately and can be used along with open chromatin information to robustly predict chromatin interactions in unseen cell types. This in-silico 3D-modelling of DNA represents a crucial step in evaluating the role of mutational processes in different cancer types."},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"11:50-12:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Ferhat Ay","Title":"Identifying genetic variants associated with chromatin looping and genome organization","Abstract":"attached as long abstract"},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"12:10-12:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Yanlin Zhang","Title":"Reference panel guided super-resolution inference of Hi-C data","Abstract":null},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"13:50-14:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Laura Cantini","Title":"Multi-modal learning for single-cell multi-omics data integration","Abstract":null},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"14:30-14:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Aryan Kamal","Title":"Active repression of alternative cell fates safeguards hepatocyte identity and prevents liver tumorigenesis","Abstract":"Maintaining a stable cell identity requires suppressing inappropriate transcriptional programs. The current dogma suggests that this is achieved through passive epigenetic silencing. Here, we propose that active transcriptional repression by safeguard repressors is crucial for lifelong cell fate stability. This process prevents the loss of cell identity and errors that may lead to developmental disorders or cancer. To support our proposition, we devised a strategy to identify safeguard repressor candidates using single-cell RNA-seq and transcription factor motif data in eighteen cell types from all germ layers. Then, to investigate whether this mechanism could prevent diseases associated with plasticity, such as cancer, we overexpressed one of the safeguard repressor candidates for hepatocytes in an in vivo model of hepatocarcinoma. We found that exogenous overexpression entirely blocked tumor initiation and improved survival. To understand the mechanism, we used direct cellular reprogramming to assess whether the candidate affects cell fate plasticity. Indeed we found that overexpression of the candidate repressed alternative cell fates by targeting - and thereby repressing - master regulators of several alternative fates. In summary, our findings suggest that cell type-specific safeguard repressors maintain lineage commitment by actively repressing alternative identities."},{"Session":"RegSys","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Wednesday","Date":"July 26th","Timespan":"14:50-15:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Pierre De Langen","Title":"Normal and cancer tissues are accurately characterised by intergenic transcription at RNA polymerase 2 binding sites","Abstract":"Intergenic transcription in normal and cancerous tissue is pervasive and incompletely understood.

In comparison to AI\/ML models that are computationally generated from big data, the KEGG model is manually created from selected publications based on human intelligence. This aspect never changed over the past 28 years, but there were two major changes. One is the change from a publicly funded database to a self-sustaining database, in which the licensing revenue received from commercial users is fully reinvested to further develop KEGG and to continue to make it freely available to academic users. The other change involves more focus on social values. The health information category of KEGG was introduced in 2010 around the time when public funding started to decline. It integrates drug labels and other regulatory data with scientific knowledge, and KEGG is now a popular web resource for drug information in the Japanese society.

Yet, the majority of these disease-associated variants lie in the non-coding part of the genome, which makes is very difficult to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. For the environmental impact on complex phenotypes, we still know very little, yet epigenetics may play a significant role. Our vision is to mechanistically understand how non-coding genetic variants affect gene regulation, how they interplay with epigenetic processes, and how these interplay impacts cellular signaling and cell-cell interactions. In this talk I will present our most recent work on cell-type specific and enhancer-mediated regulatory networks that integrate environmental signaling with genetic and epigenetic variation.

The disease is manifested when the thyroid gland fails to produce sufficient thyroid hormones. In many cases, the low levels of thyroid hormones are due to environmental factors. Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) results from thyroid development abnormalities. A large-scale study was conducted to identify functional genes associated with increased or decreased risk for hypothyroidism. The study used the UK-Biobank database, which reports on 13,687 cases of European ancestry with a prevalence of 7.5% and 2.0% for females and males, respectively. Using the gene-based proteome-wide association study (PWAS) method, we identified a ranked list of 77 statistically significant genes. We observed that many of the genes involved in hypothyroidism function in the recognition and response of immune cells, with a strong signature of autoimmunity. Expanding the analysis to additional genetic association protocols (e.g., TWAS, Open Targets Genetics, and coding-GWAS) revealed a complex etiology of hypothyroidism with genes explaining the CH developmental program, autoimmunity, and expression dysregulation in target tissues. No sex-dependent genetic effects were found. The study highlights the importance of applying complementary genome-based association methods to complex diseases. We conclude that an integration of established association methods can improve interpretability and clinical utility."},{"Session":"CAMDA","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"15:30-15:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"David Kreil","Title":"CAMDA Trophy ceremony","Abstract":null},{"Session":"CAMDA","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"15:50-16:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Serdar Bozdag","Title":"PPAD: A deep learning architecture to predict progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease","Abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary stage between cognitively normal (CN) state and AD. Not all people who have MCI convert to AD. The diagnosis of AD is made after significant symptoms of dementia such as short-term memory loss are already present. Since AD is currently an irreversible disease, diagnosis at the onset of disease brings a huge burden on patients, their caregivers, and the healthcare sector. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop methods for the early prediction AD for patients who have MCI. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been successfully used to handle Electronic Health Records (EHR) for predicting conversion from MCI to AD. However, RNN ignores irregular time intervals between successive events which occurs common in EHR data. In this study, we propose two deep learning architectures based on RNN, namely Predicting Progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (PPAD) and PPAD-Autoencoder (PPAD-AE). PPAD and PPAD-AE are designed for early predicting conversion from MCI to AD at the next visit and multiple visits ahead for patients, respectively. To minimize the effect of the irregular time intervals between visits, we propose using age in each visit as an indicator of time change between successive visits. Our experimental results conducted on Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Alzheimer‚Äôs Coordinating Center (NACC) datasets showed that our proposed models outperformed all baseline models for most prediction scenarios in terms of F2 and sensitivity."},{"Session":"CAMDA","Room":"Salle Roseraie 1\/2","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"16:10-16:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"David Kreil","Title":"Closing remarks","Abstract":null},{"Session":"CompMS","Room":"Salle Rhone 3a","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"8:30-9:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Laura Goracci","Title":"Lipostar 2: tools and workflows for LC-MS based untargeted lipidomics and epilipidomics","Abstract":"It is now widely known that lipids play a key role in a variety of diseases including diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, lipidomics, which aims at studying the structure and function and the biochemical interactions of the complete set of lipids (the lipidome) in cells, fluids, or organism, has successfully been applied in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. More recently, it has been realized that not only native lipids but also epilipids (e.g. enzymatically or non-enzymatically modified lipids, which are usually low abundant species) can represent valuable biomarkers of biochemical impairments. The need of exploring the whole lipidome and epilipidome has boosted the use of untargeted approaches, which are now facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation. Nevertheless, untargeted approaches generate a massive amount of data and therefore the use of in silico tools for data analysis and interpretation become essential.

For instance, METASPACE, the largest repository for spatial metabolomics datasets, contains over 8,000 public datasets from a range of organisms, tissues, and conditions. However, current imaging MS approaches only allow for an ambiguous annotation of molecules based on their mass-to-charge ratio, limiting mechanistic insight in disease contexts or integration with other omics data. To address this issue, we present a network-based approach that leverages lipid-metabolic networks to improve imaging MS annotations. We propose to rank candidate molecules based on the assumption that metabolites and lipids are more likely to be detected if their network upstream or downstream counterparts are detected, too. We evaluated the performance of our approach on matched single-cell and bulk LC-MS\/MS lipidomics of cultured cells, showing improved accuracy of predicted annotations confirmed by MS\/MS spectra. By reducing the number of possible annotations per ion to a few biochemically highly likely annotations, our approach helps enhance the interpretability of imaging MS datasets on a pathway level.

Investigating complex biological behavior at the cellular and molecular levels requires profiling different aspects of human biology, such as small molecules (metabolites). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based methods are ideal tools for characterizing and investigating human health by profiling metabolites. LC-MS-based metabolomics methods can yield data on thousands of features, each characterized by its descriptors: a measured mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z), chromatographic retention time (RT), and signal intensity (SI). LC-MS techniques are powerful and, at the same time, very sensitive and complex. In addition, this complexity increases when working with metabolites among different studies or LC-MS platforms. We present massSight, a computational tool to inspect and adjust trends, scale raw metabolite intensities, align peaks (annotated and unannotated) between separately acquired data sets, and remove redundancies in nontargeted LC-MS data arising from multiple ionization products of a single metabolite. The platform will come with a set of novel tools, complementary to LC-MS metabolite profiling techniques, to accurately profile features, align features across studies and platforms, perform scaling, and consolidate adducts and fragments of chemical compounds. massSight is open-source software with documentation available online at http:\/\/github.com\/omicsEye\/massSight."},{"Session":"CompMS","Room":"Salle Rhone 3a","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"11:20-11:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Oliver Crook","Title":"Residue resolved hydrogen deterium exchange using ResHDX","Abstract":"Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange mass-spectrometry (HDX-MS) has emerged as a powerful technique to explore the conformational dynamics of proteins and protein complexes in solution.

Our model treats HDX-MS as a multiple change-point problem - inferring at which residues HDX has changed. Fitting our model in the Bayesian non-parametric framework allows inference of the number of parameters, quantitative assessments of the confidence of differential HDX and uncertainty estimates of the temporal kinetics.

Significant advancements have been made in TDP in different aspects, progressively unlocking the potential of TDP in numerous biological and medical applications. However, reliable and reproducible data analysis still remains one of the major bottlenecks in TDP. A key prerequisite step for robust data analysis is the establishment of an objective estimation of proteoform-level false discovery rate (FDR) in proteoform identification. The most widely used FDR estimation scheme is FDR via target-decoy approach (TDA), which has primarily been established for bottom-up proteomics. We present evidence that the commonly used TDA-based FDR estimation may not work at the proteoform-level due to an overlooked factor, namely the erroneous deconvolution of precursor masses (simply precursor deconvolution error), which leads to incorrect FDR estimation. We argue that the conventional TDA-based FDR in proteoform identification is in fact protein-level FDR rather than proteoform-level FDR unless precursor deconvolution error rate is taken into account. To address this issue, we propose a formula to correct for proteoform-level FDR bias by combining TDA-based FDR and precursor deconvolution error rate."},{"Session":"CompMS","Room":"Salle Rhone 3a","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"13:20-14:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Bernhard Renard","Title":"Learning and Understanding Spectra","Abstract":"Proteomic mass spectra have the intriguing property of being highly redundant in some information, while being incomplete at the same time.

Statistical analysis of temperature range TPP (TPP-TR) datasets relies on comparing protein melting curves, describing the amount of non-denatured proteins as a function of temperature, between different conditions (e.g. presence or absence of a drug). However, state-of-the-art models are restricted to sigmoidal melting behaviours, while unconventional melting curves represent up to 20% of TPP-TR datasets. We thus propose a novel statistical framework based on hierarchical Gaussian Process models, to make TPP-TR datasets analysis unbiased. The model scaled to multiple conditions and complex TPP-TR protocols. Especially, the analysis of peptide-level TPP-TR datasets, considering melting curves of tryptic peptides instead of protein averages, is implemented using deeper hierarchies. Unbiased analysis of these datasets, of high value for the study of protein post-translational modifications, were yet impossible due to unconventional melting curves abundance. Collectively, this statistical framework extends the analysis of TPP-TR datasets for both protein and peptide level melting curves, offering access to thousands of previously excluded melting curves and paving the way to new biological discoveries on protein interactions, localization and functions."},{"Session":"CompMS","Room":"Salle Rhone 3a","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"15:30-15:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Kumar Saurabh Singh","Title":"Integrative omics for the discovery of biosynthetic pathways using MEANtools (MEtabolite ANticipation tools)","Abstract":"Unraveling‚ÄØthe dynamic interaction between plants and endophytes provides enormous opportunities to improve microbiome-optimized plant growth and health, which makes crops less dependent on fertilizers and pesticides.

Comparative analysis of global and local folding of genomic and subgenomic hCoV RNAs, structural characteristics and RNA stability revealed that HP-genomes folding was enriched in short-range interactions, with a preference for G-C base pairs compared to LP-genomes, where RNA folding contained a significantly higher fraction of the wobble G-U pairs. HP-genomes folding contained a greater number and higher density of predicted structural elements, especially short, locally folded hairpins. HP-genomes are also enriched in alternative RNA conformations, so short hairpins can transiently stabilize local RNA folding but can be easily disrupted to participate in alternative interactions. We showed that compensatory evolution in the isolated conserved structural elements of the HP-genomes is much more pronounced than in the LP genomes. In part, described differences between HP- and LP-genomes can be explained by the significant difference in C- and U-nucleotide composition. Significant enrichment of C-containing dinucleotides and C-terminal codons can optimize RNA stability and accelerate translation elongation rates in some regions of the HP- compared to LP-genomes."},{"Session":"EvolCompGen","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"8:40-8:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Rajeev Azad","Title":"Reconstructing horizontal gene flow network to understand prokaryotic evolution","Abstract":"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a major source of phenotypic innovation and a mechanism of niche adaptation in prokaryotes.

Here, we show that the gene content evolution of metabolic systems is generally predictable by applying ancestral gene content reconstruction and machine learning techniques to ~3000 bacterial genomes. Our framework, Evodictor, successfully predicted gene gain and loss evolution at the branches of the reference phylogenetic tree, suggesting that evolutionary pressures and constraints on metabolic systems are universally shared. Investigation of pathway architectures and meta-analysis of metagenomic datasets confirmed that these evolutionary patterns have physiological and ecological bases as functional dependencies among metabolic reactions and bacterial habitat changes. Last, pan-genomic analysis of intraspecies gene content variations proved that even \"ongoing\" evolution in extant bacterial species is predictable in our framework."},{"Session":"EvolCompGen","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"10:00-10:20","Format":"Live-stream","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Alexey Markin","Title":"Phylogenetic Diversity Statistics for All Clades in a Phylogeny","Abstract":null},{"Session":"EvolCompGen","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"10:20-10:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Felix L.

The wild ancestor of beet crops is the sea beet Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima. Species and subspecies of wild beets are readily crossable with cultivated beets and are thus available for crop improvement. Here we present our recent work on genetic relationships within the genus Beta, based on over 750 sequenced beet genomes. For genomic comparisons we used a k-mer based approach (Ondov et al., 2016) followed by phylogenetic tree construction. This allowed us to propose the origin of domestication of cultivated beets, and to provide comprehensive insights into the phylogeny of wild and cultivated beets. To underline the usefulness of k-mer based approaches in comparative genomics we compared our results to a classical SNP-chip based approach. Our workflow allows easy classification of wild beets of unknown origin and reveals a surprisingly high abundance of misclassified (sub-)species assignments in public seed banks which has impact on downstream analyses. Furthermore, we integrated the phylogenetic data with information regarding pathogen resistance. In summary, our work showcases the multiple usages of whole-genome sequencing data in the context of crop plant genomics."},{"Session":"EvolCompGen","Room":"Pasteur Auditorium","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"10:30-10:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Maria Chikina","Title":"AFconverge: alignment-free phylogenetic method for predicting convergent evolution of regulatory elements","Abstract":"Comparative genomics can unveil genetic changes that underlie morphological differences, but elucidating adaptations of regulatory elements (REs) is still challenging. Most existing methods are limited to computing element-level signals from multiple sequence alignments, which is unsuitable for REs that are modularly composed of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs that can turn over and vary in arrangement. To quantify how selective forces act on such flexible sequence space requires a model that can account for functional conservation in the presence of sequence divergence. We introduce AFconverge, an ‚Äúalignment-free‚Äù method that predicts the patterns of regulatory motif adaptations underlying phenotypic convergence. AFconverge quantifies the presence of TF motifs across RE orthologs and correlates each motif with the phenotype using a phylogenetically-constrained association test. Benchmarking experiments with the convergent case of mammalian vision loss showed that AFconverge outperformed competing methods at predicting significant divergence of ocular-related promoters. We then applied AFconverge to investigate the pan-mammalian regulatory adaptations underlying extended lifespan, and identified global gains and losses of longevity-associated motif features. AFconverge also revealed correlation patterns of motif selection, highlighting pluripotency, germline development, immunity, and pancreatic functions as key drivers of longevity.

In other words, the higher substitution rates of genomic segments (e.g., genes) under positive selection are balanced out with the lower substitution rates of genomic segments under negative selection, leading to an apparent time-independent GSR under apparent neutral selection.

Best reciprocal hit sequences spaced by less than 10 non-homologous sequences were considered tandem duplications. Individual genes collected by this procedure were aligned with the respective orthologous sequences of other vertebrates. For each position we calculated the overall conservation score and the difference score between orthogroup pairs. The scores were used to build two-dimensional maps based on the contact maps obtained from Alphafold structures.

This approach reduces random noise by omitting low contribution variances and considers a broader range of environments by managing differences in PC contribution variances. We implement two procedures to balance the contribution of PCs: using the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) and a subagging ensemble method. Comparisons using the Arabidopsis RNAseq platform showed that the methods using PCA and ensemble computation outperformed those without PCA. We confirmed this result on the 17 coexpression platforms in ATTED-II. Our proposed method improves gene coexpression performance by combining PCA and ensemble computation, considering both major and minor environmental components.

To test this, the nine sites that differ between human and rat were mutated in the human Œ≤-myosin to match the rat sequence.

Clustering is often a first step in bioinformatics workflows to reduce sequences to more manageable numbers. Therefore, clustering presents a scalability bottleneck that is constrained by time and memory limitations. Here, I describe the development of Clusterize, a novel method for accurately clustering with linear time and memory complexity. The Clusterize algorithm linearizes the clustering problem through a process termed relatedness sorting. After linear-time relatedness sorting, each sequence only needs to be compared to fixed number of nearby sequences in the ordering and clustered if within the similarity threshold. I compare the performance of Clusterize relative to popular clustering programs, including CD-HIT, MMseqs, and UCLUST. Clusterize is able to quickly and accurately cluster tens of millions of homologous sequences, such as 16S amplicons, and non-homologous sequences, such as the UniProt database. Clusterize is far more accurate than another linear time clustering algorithm, Linclust, on many typical clustering tasks. Overall, Clusterize represents a novel approach for scaling clustering to new heights while assisting with the continual flood of biological sequences.

Given the sensitivity of genomic data, it is crucial to conduct collaborative studies while preserving the privacy of the individuals. However, before starting any collaborative research effort, the quality of the data needs to be assessed. One of the essential steps of the quality control process is population stratification: identifying the presence of genetic difference in individuals due to subpopulations. One of the common methods used to group genomes of individuals based on ethnicity is principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, we propose a framework to perform population stratification using PCA across multiple collaborators in a privacy-preserving way. In our proposed client-server-based scheme, we initially let the server train a global PCA model on a publicly available genomic dataset which contains individuals from multiple populations. The global PCA model is later used to reduce the dimensionality of the local data by each collaborator (client). After adding noise to achieve local differential privacy (LDP), the collaborators send metadata (in the form of their local PCA outputs) about their research datasets to the server, which then aligns the local PCA results to identify the genetic differences among collaborators' datasets. Our results on real genomic data show that the proposed framework can perform population stratification with high accuracy while preserving the privacy of the research participants."},{"Session":"General Computational Biology","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"11:00-11:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Muyu Yang","Title":"UNADON: Transformer-based model to predict genome-wide chromosome spatial position","Abstract":"The spatial positioning of chromosomes relative to functional nuclear bodies is intertwined with genome functions such as transcription, but the sequence patterns and epigenomic features that collectively influence chromatin spatial positioning in a genome-wide manner are not well understood.

Our proposed mvMAPIT builds upon this strategy by taking advantage of correlation structure between traits to improve the identification of variants involved in epistasis.

Together with reasonable model approximations, our proposed approach is scalable to moderately sized GWA studies. With simulations, we illustrate the benefits of mvMAPIT over univariate (or single-trait) epistatic mapping strategies.

GIN promotes cell transformation by alteration of cancer driver genes, and it may also facilitate tumor cells adaptation to therapy. The DNA repair machinery plays a master role preventing DNA damage and GIN, and indeed various DNA repair pathways are often deficient in cancer. One of these pathways is translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), which allows replication forks to bypass bulky DNA lesions, preventing gross chromosomal rearrangements but at the cost of introducing point mutations and indels. TLS is a conserved mechanism that diversified during evolution leading to multiple TLS enzymes with different, but overlapping specificities for DNA lesions in human cells. However, given their common ancestry, TLS polymerases perform redundant functions and can substitute for each other, making very difficult their study using single KOs. Here, we develop a double knock-out strategy using CRISPR-Cas12 to analyze pairwise deletions of TLS enzymes in human cells, and unveil interactions between them under a wide range of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in lung adenocarcinoma and ovarian carcinoma cell models.

However, current techniques have limited temporal resolution, which makes it difficult to measure very fast biogenesis rates. Additionally, these methods do not allow to measure the variability in elongation rates within the same gene. To address these issues, we developed \"kinetic barcoding\" that involves stepwise labeling of nascent RNA with multiple nucleosides to measure multiple time points within a single sequencing library. By sequentially adding 5-ethynyl-uridine (5eU), 6-thio-guanosine (6sG), and 4-thio-uridine (4sU) at different time points we can measure nascent RNA intermediates at multiple time scales in a single experiment. We isolate nascent RNA by biotinylating and pulling down 5eU-labeled RNA, followed by alkylation of the 6sU and 4sU thiol groups to generate nucleotide-specific substitutions where these nucleotides were incorporated. This allows us to distinguish molecules transcribed during the first, second, and final labeling windows by their substitution patterns.

In order to discover new immunotherapy targets, we developed a computational pipeline that relies on large cohorts of short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to detect molecular patterns that are enriched or exclusively found in cancer and not normal tissues. The pipeline surveys and quantifies splicing variations and gene expression in individual cancer samples and compares them to an array of over 7,000 samples covering 86 normal tissues and blood cell types.

Here we find that methionine dependence is associated with severe dysregulation of pre-mRNA splicing. When cultured in homocysteine medium, cancer cells failed to efficiently methylate the spliceosomal snRNP component SmD1, which resulted in reduced binding to the Survival-of-Motor-Neuron protein SMN leading to aberrant splicing. These effects were specific for cancer cells as neither Sm protein methylation nor splicing fidelity was affected when non-tumorigenic cells were cultured in homocysteine medium. Sm protein methylation is catalyzed by Protein Arginine Methyl Transferase 5 (Prmt5), and reducing methionine concentrations in the culture medium sensitized cancer cells to Prmt5 inhibition.

Using deep learning models designed to distinguish between regions of open chromatin in retained introns and non-retained introns, we identified motifs enriched in IR events. Most of the motifs learned by the network had significant hits to known human transcription factors--more so than RNA-binding proteins.

Combinatorically, the order of intron excision could proceed down thousands of different paths, each of which would expose different landscapes of cis-elements that contribute to alternative splicing (AS). How intron splicing proceeds across human pre-mRNAs is not well understood due to technical limitations in the quantitative analysis of long RNA molecules. Here, we investigated post-transcriptional splicing order in human cells using direct RNA nanopore sequencing. We found that multi-intron splicing order is not stochastic, but largely pre-determined, with most genes using only a few predominant splicing orders to reach a fully spliced transcript. Strikingly, splicing orders were conserved across cell types and during motor neuron differentiation, indicating that for the studied introns, splicing order is fixed. Moreover, splicing orders did not change to accommodate AS, rather introns flanking alternatively spliced exons during differentiation were largely excised last, after their neighboring introns. Interestingly, sequencing of human lymphoblast cell lines from different individuals revealed several examples of allele-specific splicing order, suggesting that genetic sequence contributes to splicing order determination.

Protocols capturing and sequencing RNA 3'-ends have uncovered widespread intronic polyadenylation (IPA) in normal and disease conditions, where it is currently attributed to stochastic variations in the pre-mRNA processing. Here, we took advantage of the massive amount of RNA-seq data generated by the Genotype Tissue Expression project (GTEx) to simultaneously identify and match tissue-specific expression of intronic polyadenylation sites with tissue-specific splicing. A combination of computational methods including the analysis of short reads with non-templated adenines revealed that APA events are more abundant in introns than in exons. While the rate of IPA in composite terminal exons and skipped terminal exons expectedly correlates with splicing, we observed a considerable fraction of IPA events that lack AS support and attributed them to spliced polyadenylated introns (SPI). We hypothesize that SPIs represent transient byproducts of a dynamic coupling between APA and AS, in which the spliceosome removes the intron while it is being cleaved and polyadenylated. These findings indicate that cotranscriptional pre-mRNA splicing could serve as a rescue mechanism to suppress premature transcription termination at intronic polyadenylation sites."},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"15:30-15:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Alexander J√ºrgen Petri","Title":"isONform: reference-free transcriptome reconstruction from Oxford Nanopore data","Abstract":null},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"15:50-16:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Hagen Tilgner","Title":"Technologies for RNA isoform investigations across mouse brain development and brain regions as well as human brain structures","Abstract":null},{"Session":"iRNA","Room":"Pasteur Lounge","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"16:20-16:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"Klemens Hertel","Title":"Poster prize and closing remarks","Abstract":null},{"Session":"SysMod","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"8:30-8:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"remarks","Speaker":"Matteo Barberis","Title":"Introduction to SysMod 2023","Abstract":"The SysMod COSI organizes annual gatherings at ISMB.

The higher layers usually correspond to a ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù of physiological events, whereas the lower levels account for increasing granularity and detail. When investigating a system at a high level, it is infeasible to carry along all details from lower levels, partly for technical reasons, but more so because they would overwhelm insights at the higher level due to their sheer numbers and the fact that they typically run on much faster time scales. We address this situation with the first application of ‚ÄúTemplate-and-Anchor modeling‚Äù in the proposed implementation. A template is a high-level model that focuses exclusively on the main physiological components. Anchor models provide specific biological details characterizing the mechanisms that govern the system and are represented in the template model as variables. We use this approach to investigate the effect of dioxin exposure on human health. By adjusting parameter values within the anchor models, the overall template model can be personalized, thereby offering the option of personal health risk assessments."},{"Session":"SysMod","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"10:00-10:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Mathieu Bolteau","Title":"Boolean networks as a framework to model human preimplantation development","Abstract":"This study addresses the need to understand better human embryonic development to improve assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization.

These models are inferred from the pseudo-perturbations and prior-regulatory networks and optimally fit scRNAseq data for each developmental stage.

The first step consists in building condition-specific models representing the metabolic impact of each exposure condition, while taking into account the diversity of possible optimal solutions with a partial enumeration step. Then, 2 conditions, represented by 2 sets of several optimal condition-specific networks, are compared by extracting differentially activated reactions (DARs) between these 2 sets. Finally, using distance-based clustering and a subnetwork extraction method, DARs are grouped into clusters of functionally interconnected metabolic reactions.

The current gold standard for inferring parameter distributions across cell populations is the Global Two Stage (GTS) approach for nonlinear mixed-effects models. Although the GTS method is reliable, its current implementation requires repeated use of non-convex optimization, which is not guaranteed to converge, while each optimization run requires multiple simulations of the system. We propose an alternative, computationally efficient implementation of the GTS method for mixed-effects dynamical systems which are nonlinear in the states but linear in the parameters (a class that encompasses a wide range of models such as those based on mass-action kinetics). For such systems, point parameter estimates can be obtained using least squares regression on time derivatives of smoothed measurement data, an approach called gradient matching. Here, we extend the application of gradient matching to the inference problem for mixed-effects dynamical systems and integrate it into the GTS method by properly accounting for uncertainties in individual cell parameters in the first stage. We also present an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and associated parameter uncertainty estimates which are applicable when not all system states are observed, as is typically the case for biological systems."},{"Session":"SysMod","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"11:20-11:40","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Domagoj Doresic","Title":"Efficient integration of censored, ordinal, and nonlinear-monotone data in parameter estimation for ODE models","Abstract":null},{"Session":"SysMod","Room":"Salle Rhone 2","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"11:40-12:00","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Srijith Sasikumar","Title":"Exploring metabolic plasticity of quantitative trait nucleotides and their combinations using systems biology approaches","Abstract":"Several studies attempted to link genotype-phenotype relationships yet it remains unclear how genetic interactions between quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) can drive phenotypic variation. If QTNs modulate phenotypic variation in a metabolically driven process, it is obvious to ask: how do these QTNs individually and in combinations change the connectivity of metabolic regulators? Furthermore, how does metabolic flux distribution change as QTN interacts? To test our hypothesis, we harness the gene expression data obtained from an allele replacement panel of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and study how QTNs in the three genes: two coding polymorphisms in IME1 and RSF1 and two non-coding polymorphisms in RME1 and IME1, can modulate sporulation efficiency variation. Using differential gene expression analysis and network analysis we show several metabolic regulators change connectivity as QTNs interacts. We integrated the gene expression data of each QTN combination into genome-scale metabolic models to reconstruct QTN-specific metabolic models. Using genome-scale differential flux analysis we observed flux variation in the amino acid biosynthesis pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, and glycerophospholipid metabolism as a consequence of QTN-QTN interactions.

The present study aimed to identify metabolic perturbations during the phenotypic shifts of three distinct morphologies (2D monolayers and two geometrically individual three-dimensional spheroidal states) of the high-grade serous ovarian cancer line OVCAR-3. We performed quantitative proteomics and integrated protein states onto genome-scale metabolic models to construct context-specific metabolic models for each morphological stage of the OVCAR-3 cell line.

Our method combines event and transcript level quantifications to identify variants associated with a more comprehensive set of splicing phenotypes that includes intron retention and alternative transcript start\/end which are not considered by existing approaches. We also develop statistical methods to handle discrete and highly correlated multivariate splicing phenotypes which have more power to detect sQTLs while reducing false discoveries. Through modeling of overdispered count data, phenotype correlation, missing values, and heteroscedasticity, our model outperforms current methods which were adapted 'as is' from eQTL studies but are still the standard in the field. Using GTEX as a case study, we show that over 25% of sQTLs are not reported across multiple tissues. To facilitate downstream variant interpretation, we also introduce improved visualization tools and identify novel variants associated with intron retention in Alzheimer‚Äôs genes."},{"Session":"VarI","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"14:00-14:10","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Nina Baumgarten","Title":"A statistical approach to identify regulatory DNA variations combined with epigenomics data reveals novel non-coding disease genes","Abstract":null},{"Session":"VarI","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"14:10-14:20","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Eleni Giannoulatou","Title":"SpliceSM: machine learning discovery of splice-altering variants using susceptibility maps","Abstract":null},{"Session":"VarI","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"14:20-15:00","Format":"Live-stream","Type":"invited","Speaker":"Nicky Whiffin","Title":"Strategies to annotate and interpret non-coding variants in rare disease","Abstract":"It is increasingly being recognised that variants outside of protein-coding regions of the genome play an important role in rare disease. However, it can often be difficult to identify and annotate non-coding region variants due to the lack of available tools and limitations in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, I will discuss our recent approaches to annotate and interpret non-coding region variants, in particular using the Genomics England 100,000 genomes project. I will also discuss our work to elucidate disease-causing mechanisms associated with high-impact variants in untranslated regions, and development of clinical guidelines to enable routine classification of non-coding region variants in clinical settings."},{"Session":"VarI","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"15:30-15:50","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"proceedings","Speaker":"Yasser Mohseni Behbahani","Title":"Deep Local Analysis deconstructs protein - protein interfaces and accurately estimates binding affinity changes upon mutation","Abstract":"The spectacular recent advances in protein and protein complex structure prediction hold promise for reconstructing interactomes at large scale and residue resolution. Beyond determining the 3D arrangement of interacting partners, modeling approaches should be able to unravel the impact of sequence variations on the strength of the association. In this work, we report on Deep Local Analysis (DLA), a novel and efficient deep learning framework that relies on a strikingly simple deconstruction of protein interfaces into small locally oriented residue-centered cubes and on 3D convolutions recognizing patterns within cubes. Merely based on the two cubes associated with the wild-type and the mutant residues, DLA accurately estimates the binding affinity change for the associated complexes. It achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.735 on about 400 mutations on unseen complexes. Its generalization capability on blind datasets of complexes is higher than the state-of-the-art methods. We show that taking into account the evolutionary constraints on residues contributes to predictions. We also discuss the influence of conformational variability on performance. Beyond the predictive power on the effects of mutations, DLA is a general framework for transferring the knowledge gained from the available non-redundant set of complex protein structures to various tasks. For instance, given a single partially masked cube, it recovers the identity and physico-chemical class of the central residue. Given an ensemble of cubes representing an interface, it predicts the function of the complex.

In this paper, we propose a novel Genome Interpretation paradigm, which aims at directly modeling the genotype-to-phenotype relationship, and we focus on A. thaliana since it is the best studied model organism in plant genetics. Our model, called Galiana, is the first end-to-end Neural Network (NN) approach following the genomes in\/phenotypes out paradigm and it is trained to predict 288 real-valued Arabidopsis thaliana phenotypes from Whole Genome sequencing data. We show that 75 of these phenotypes are predicted with a Pearson correlation ‚â•0.4, and are mostly related to flowering traits. We show that our end-to-end NN approach achieves better performances and larger phenotype coverage than models predicting single phenotypes from the GWAS-derived known associated genes. Galiana is also fully interpretable, thanks to the Saliency Maps gradient-based approaches."},{"Session":"VarI","Room":"Salle Rhone 1","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"16:20-16:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"abstract","Speaker":"Julien Gagneur","Title":"Closing Remarks","Abstract":null},{"Session":"Keynote","Room":"Lumière Auditorium","Weekday":"Thursday","Date":"July 27th","Timespan":"16:30-17:30","Format":"Live from venue","Type":"keynote","Speaker":"Mark Gerstein","Title":"A Gradual Evolution in Bioinformatics Research","Abstract":"This talk will survey my lab's computational biology research from the 1990s to the present and touch upon the broader directions of the field.

Finally, I'll discuss some of our current work developing models for variant impact based on allele-specific binding and how this highlights the role of transcription-factor binding motifs that are particularly sensitive to mutation. I'll end with thoughts on where I think the field is going.
